When we talk about the use of fertilizers in agriculture, including tea production, nitrogen fertilizers most often come to mind, and they are indeed the most used group. They allow you to increase yields and use the land more effectively. However, there are also negative effects - the taste of the products deteriorates, and abuse leads to the release of nitric oxide (I), which is a greenhouse gas.

An article on the importance of magnesium in tea cultivation was published in the journal Scientia Horticulturae. Magnesium is involved in the synthesis of sugars and lipids, the control of plant hormones, it is an essential element of chlorophyll - an important plant pigment involved in the photosynthesis process, and additionally affects the absorption of other elements, including: nitrogen and potassium.

The authors conducted research in a tea field in Anxi (cultivar - Tieguanyin), using different doses of magnesium. It turned out that the use of magnesium significantly increases the absorption of nitrogen, and the greater availability of nitrogen also increases the concentration of free amino acids in tea (on average by about 14%), while almost not affecting the content of polyphenols, improving the taste of tea.

It is also interesting that such supplementation increases the density of buds on tea bushes by about 13% - the mechanism of this phenomenon is not entirely clear, but it is probably related to the regulation of hormones (the ratio of 3-indoacetic acid to abscisic acid).

It also has a positive impact on the environment - nitrogen is used more effectively, the release of nitric oxide (I) is reduced (here the authors use a mathematical model instead of practical data, but these models describe the processes quite well). Taking into account magnesium concentrations for tea cultivation may therefore be one of the cornerstones of sustainable tea production.
